2 stacks<br />
You need to sort a stack of integers with the fewest moves.<br />
Available moves:<br />
pa - move number from stack B to A<br />
pb - move number from stack A to B<br />
sa - swap two numbers at the top of stack A<br />
sb - swap two numbers at the top of stack B<br />
ra - first argument becomes the last one, rest goes up (stack A)<br />
rb - first argument becomes the last one, rest goes up (stack B)<br />
rr - ra and rb at the same time<br />
rra - like ra but in the other way<br />
rrb - like rb but in the other way<br />
rrr - rra and rrb at the same time <br />
