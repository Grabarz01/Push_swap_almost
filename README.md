2 stacks
You need to sort a stack of integers with the fewest moves.
Available moves:
pa - move number from stack B to A
pb - move number from stack A to B
sa - swap two numbers at the top of stack A
sb - swap two numbers at the top of stack B
ra - first argument becomes the last one, rest goes up (stack A)
rb - first argument becomes the last one, rest goes up (stack B)
rr - ra and rb at the same time
rra - like ra but in the other way
rrb - like rb but in the other way
rrr - rra and rrb at the same time
